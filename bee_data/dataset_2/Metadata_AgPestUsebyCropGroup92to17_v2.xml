      <abstract>This data release provides state-level estimates of annual agricultural use of pesticide compounds by major crop or crop group for states in the conterminous United States, for the time period 1992-2017, compiled from data used to make county-level estimates by means of methods described in Thelin and Stone (2013) and Baker and Stone (2015). The source of these data is the same as the published county-level pesticide use estimates for 1992-2009 (Stone, 2013), estimates for 2008-2012 (Baker and Stone, 2015), and estimates for 2013-17 (Wieben, 2019). County-level by-crop estimates are not published because of the increased uncertainty in estimating the geographic distribution of compounds applied to specific crops. High-acreage crops (corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, and alfalfa) are individually aggregated to state level while low-acreage crops are combined into groups (vegetables and fruit, orchards and grapes, pasture and hay, and other crops) prior to aggregating to the state level.

This data release contains two tables of state-level annual agricultural pesticide use estimates by crop or crop group (one for low estimates and one for high estimates) and associated metadata. These data were used to produce annual time-series charts for individual pesticide by crop or crop group for 1992-2017 available on the Pesticide National Synthesis Project (PNSP) webpage: https://doi.org/doi:10.5066/F7NP22KM.

Data for some compounds were missing from the version 1 estimates. Pesticide use estimates for compounds with missing data have been updated in version 2.0.

      <purpose>The purpose of this dataset is to provide state-level annual pesticide use estimates for major crop or crop group for states in the conterminous United States. These estimates are provided to increase the understanding on which crops these compounds are applied.</purpose>
      <supplinf>State estimates of annual agricultural pesticide use by crop or crop group are provided as two downloadable, tab-delimited files, which are organized by state Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, state, compound, year, units, and amount in kilograms (kg) for the crops and crop groups: corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, vegetables and fruit, rice, orchards and grapes, alfalfa, pasture and hay, and other crops (crop and crop group definitions are documented in the Entity and Attribute Information section). Pesticide-use data compiled by proprietary surveys of farm operations located within Crop Reporting Districts (CRD) were used in conjunction with annual harvested-crop acreage reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) County Agricultural Production Survey (CAPS) (U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Agricultural Statistics Service, variously dated) and the USDA 2012 and 2017 Census of Agriculture (Ag Census) (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2014, 2019) to calculate use rates per harvested crop acre, or an ‘estimated pesticide use’ (EPest) rate, for each crop by year (Thelin and Stone, 2013). County-level estimates for 2013-17 (Wieben, 2019) were appended to estimates previously made for 1992-2012 (Baker and Stone, 2015; Stone, 2013) prior to aggregating to the state level.

The two files, LowEstimate_AgPestUsebyCropGroup92to17.txt (EPest-low) and HighEstimate_AgPestUsebyCropGroup92to17.txt (EPest-high), provide a range of pesticide-use rates (Thelin and Stone, 2013 and Baker and Stone, 2015) where a pesticide-use rate is not available for a crop from a CRD. Both methods incorporated surveyed and extrapolated rates to estimate pesticide use for counties, but EPest-low and EPest-high estimation procedures differed in how they treated situations in which a CRD was surveyed and pesticide use was not reported (missing) for a particular pesticide-by-crop combination. The EPest-low estimate is assigned a null value (blank) when there is not enough information to determine whether use occurred but was not captured by the survey or whether use did not occur for that pesticide and crop. EPest-high, however, treats missing data for surveyed CRDs as pesticide use likely to occur and therefore calculates a use rate from neighboring CRDs or CRDs within the same region to estimate the pesticide-by-crop use. This method is described in detail by Thelin and Stone (2013). The EPest-high estimate is based generally on the median of reported pesticide-by-crop use rates from surveyed farmers in neighboring CRDs and, in some cases, CRDs within the same USDA Farm Resource Region (Thelin and Stone, 2013). EPest-low annual-use totals can be greater than EPest-high totals when the low method of estimation concentrates the use to a particular geographic area while the high method spreads the use over a larger geographic area. There is uncertainty in both the high and low estimates that is difficult to quantify. A user should become familiar with the two methods to decide which estimate is best for a specific application.

Beginning 2015, the provider of the surveyed pesticide data used to derive the county-level use estimates discontinued making estimates for seed treatment application of pesticides because of complexity and uncertainty. Pesticide use estimates prior to 2015 include estimates with seed treatment application.

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>For all States except California, pesticide-use data compiled by proprietary surveys of farm operations located within U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Reporting Districts (CRDs)—a collection of contiguous counties within each State—were used to calculate pesticide applications per crop acre, or an “estimated pesticide use” (EPest) rate, for each pesticide compound used in a CRD.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20190730</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>County-use estimates were then calculated by multiplying EPest rates by harvested-crop acres for each pesticide-by-crop combination in each county with annual harvested-crop acres. County annual harvested-crop acres reported by the USDA Census of Agriculture (Ag Census) and CAPS (U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Agricultural Statistics Service, variously dated) were used in this compilation. Estimates were produced using SAS software.

The Ag Census is the most uniform and complete source of crop-acre estimates for all counties in the United States. The Ag Census is published every 5th year, with CAPS reporting crop-acre estimates for selected crops and counties for interim Ag Census years. For the 1992-2009 estimates (Stone, 2013), the 2008-2012 estimates (Baker and Stone, 2015), and the 2013-17 estimates (Wieben, 2019), acreages for crops not surveyed by CAPS were interpolated linearly between census years.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20190730</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Where a pesticide-use rate is not available for a crop from a CRD, both EPest-low and EPest-high estimates were made to provide a range of pesticide-use rates (Thelin and Stone, 2013 and Baker and Stone, 2015). Both methods incorporated surveyed and extrapolated rates to estimate pesticide use for counties. See Supplemental Information for an explanation on how EPest-low and EPest-high methods differ.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Individual crops were assigned to the appropriate major crop or crop group (Alfalfa, Corn, Cotton, Orchards and grapes, Other crops, Pasture and hay, Rice, Soybeans, Vegetables and fruit, and Wheat). County EPest-high and EPest-low were then aggregated to the state level.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The original dataset was incomplete. Data for select compounds were missing from the original (version 1) pesticide use estimates. Pesticide use estimates were reprocessed following the above steps and pesticide use estimates for compounds with missing data have been updated in version 2.0. Specifically:

1. The following compounds were missing from the original pesticide use estimates for years 2013-17, for states except California. Pesticide use for the missing compounds has been added to the version 2.0 estimates. Note: there are no pesticide use estimates for these compounds for 2017.
AMETRYN, ASULAM, AZINPHOS-METHYL, BACILLUS FIRMUS, BACTERIOPHAGE, CARBOXIN, DISULFOTON, ENDOSULFAN, FENAMIPHOS, FORAMSULFURON, HYMEXAZOL, IMAZALIL, IMAZAPYR, IPCONAZOLE, MANEB, METHAMIDOPHOS, NAPTALAM, PASTEURIA NISHIZAWAE, PENFLUFEN, PINOLENE, SEDAXANE, SUCROSE OCTANOATE, TCMTB, TEBUFENOZIDE, THIAZOPYR, TOLCLOFOS-METHYL, TRIADIMENOL, TRINEXAPAC, TRITICONAZOLE

2. The following compounds had incomplete estimates in the original pesticide use estimates as a result of missing use estimates for sugarcane for years 2013-17. Pesticide use on sugarcane has been added to the version 2.0 estimates for 2013-17.
2,4-D, ATRAZINE, AZOXYSTROBIN, CHLORANTRANILIPROLE, CHLORIMURON, CLOMAZONE, CLOPYRALID, CYFLUTHRIN, CYHALOTHRIN-LAMBDA, DICAMBA, DIURON, FLUBENDIAMIDE, FLUMIOXAZIN, FLUXAPYROXAD, GLYPHOSATE, HALOSULFURON, HEXAZINONE, IMIDACLOPRID, MESOTRIONE, METCONAZOLE, METRIBUZIN, NOVALURON, PARAQUAT, PENDIMETHALIN, PHORATE, PROPICONAZOLE, PYRACLOSTROBIN, SULFENTRAZONE, TERBACIL, TRIFLOXYSTROBIN, TRIFLOXYSULFURON, TRIFLURALIN</procdesc>
